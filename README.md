# Greatest Common Divisor

First of all we got two numbers, you can get these numbers from the user too, thatâ€™s not a big deal. Then we applied a for loop upto any of that numbers and used a condition that if for both the numbers the modulus with loop increment is same, then that is our greatest common divisor of numbers.
